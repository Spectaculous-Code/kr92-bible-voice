# Windsurf Rules

1) Always load context first:
   - @/Docs/01-PRD.md
   - @/Docs/02-DESIGN.md
   - @/Docs/03-API.md
   - @/Docs/04-DEV-WORKFLOW.md

2) Workflow = Plan → Patch → Stop.
   - Show unified diffs; no direct file writes without preview.
   - Never delete/move files without explicit approval.

3) Tech constraints:
   - Vite + React + TS + shadcn + Tailwind only.
   - Supabase client from src/lib/supabase.ts; no ad-hoc fetch to DB.
   - Use React Query for server data; Zod for DTOs.

4) Testing & Quality:
   - Add/maintain Vitest + Playwright tests.
   - Fix lints/types; if Cascade introduces lints, auto-fix (Cascade). 

5) Security & Privacy:
   - No secrets in code.
   - Respect RLS; server-side checks on mutations.

6) Documentation:
   - When changing behavior, update PRD or DESIGN accordingly.

7) Communication:
   - Be concise. Provide assumptions + rollback plan for risky changes.
